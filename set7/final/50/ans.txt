The issue occurs because, when opening an fstream, we need to specify the wanted mode explicitly if we want the program to perform the operation we want. While ofstream is designed specifically for output (as suggested by prefix "o"), fstream can be used for either input or output, or a combination of both (such as ios::in | ios::out for both reading and writing). Consequently, when the mode is not specified, ofstream is designed to create a file and operate in output mode (ios::out) by default, while fstream is not designed to even create a file at all in such a case. However, if the output mode (ios::out) is indeed specified, fstream performs equivalently to ofstream. With this simple addition, the given program can be fixed.
