start with main.cc, which tests the symbol table by adding and displaying symbols. then, look at symtab.h and symtab.cc to see how symbols are stored and searched using binary search. Then, check symbol.h/symbol.cc to understand how each symbol holds its name and value. Finally, review value.h/value.cc to see how different data types (int, double, char) are managed using a union. This order helps you see the overall flow before diving into the details of each class.
