1. Basic new and delete. Both are used to dynamically allocate memory. The new operator denotes a request for memory allocatoin on the Free Store. Delete is used to deallocate memory for a single object.

example an int pointer variable points to memory allocated by the operator new then after delete is used to release the memory
int *number = new int;
delete number

2. Operator new[] and delete[] to dynamically delete and allocate arrays. Example when you want to allocate and delete an array of 20 integers int *intarr[20] =new int[20] 
delete[] intarr
