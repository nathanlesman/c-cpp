definition:
int x[8];

rewritten pointer expression:
*(x + 2) = *(x + 3);

semantics:
Set the value of the 2nd element to the value of the 3rd element.

definition:
char *argv[8];

rewritten pointer expression:
cout << *(argv + 2);

senantics:
Print the string pointed to by the 3rd element of argv.

definition:
int x[8];

rewritten pointer expression:
(&x[10] - &x[3]);

semantics:
Compute the number of elements between the 4th and the 11th element in x.

definition:
main's argv;

rewritten pointer expression:
(*argv)++;

semantics:
Increment the pointer argv[0], so that it points to the next character of the first string.

definition:
main's argv;

rewritten pointer expression
(*argv)++;

semantics:
Move the pointer argv to the next argument in the array.

definition:
main's argv;

rewritten pointer expression:
++(*argv);

semantics:
Increment the pointer argv[0], so it points to the next character of the first string.

definition:
main's argv;

rewritten pointer statement:
++(*(*(argv + 0) + 2));

semantics:
Increment the character at index 2 of the first argument in argv.
